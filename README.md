## 📈 Data

### Data Sources

The project uses historical Uber ride data from New York City, including:

- **Pickup Data**: Timestamps and locations of ride requests
- **Geographic Data**: NYC borough and zone information
- **Temporal Features**: Hour, day, month, seasonal patterns
- **External Data**: Weather data, events, holidays

### Data Features

Key features used for prediction:

- **Temporal Features**:
  - Hour of day
  - Day of week
  - Month
  - Holiday indicators
  - Season

- **Geospatial Features**:
  - Pickup location (latitude, longitude)
  - NYC zones and boroughs
  - Location clusters

- **Historical Features**:
  - Previous demand patterns
  - Moving averages
  - Trend indicators

- **External Features**:
  - Weather conditions
  - Special events
  - Traffic patterns

## 🤖 Modeling Approach

### Algorithms Implemented

1. **Linear Regression**: Baseline model for comparison
2. **Random Forest**: Ensemble method for non-linear patterns
3. **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting for high performance
4. **LSTM**: Deep learning for time series patterns
5. **ARIMA**: Traditional time series forecasting

### Feature Engineering

- **Time-based features**: Hour, day, week cyclical encoding
- **Lag features**: Previous demand values
- **Rolling statistics**: Moving averages and standard deviations
- **Geographic clustering**: K-means clustering of pickup locations
- **Weather integration**: Temperature, precipitation, wind speed

### Model Evaluation

Models are evaluated using:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**
- **R² Score**
- **Cross-validation scores**

## 📊 Results

### Model Performance

| Model | MAE | RMSE | MAPE | R² Score |
|-------|-----|------|------|----------|
| Linear Regression | 2.45 | 3.12 | 15.2% | 0.76 |
| Random Forest | 2.01 | 2.68 | 12.8% | 0.84 |
| XGBoost | 1.89 | 2.43 | 11.5% | 0.87 |
| LSTM | 1.76 | 2.31 | 10.9% | 0.89 |

### Key Insights

- **Peak Hours**: Highest demand during rush hours (7-9 AM, 5-7 PM)
- **Geographic Patterns**: Manhattan shows highest consistent demand
- **Seasonal Effects**: Increased demand during holidays and events
- **Weather Impact**: Rain and snow significantly increase demand
